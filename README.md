# ExoVol: Advanced Volatility Surface Modeling & Forecasting Tool  

## Overview  
ExoVol is an advanced **volatility surface modeling and forecasting tool** that integrates **deep learning and financial modeling** to enhance options market analysis. Built with **Python and TensorFlow**, ExoVol leverages a **hybrid VAE-LSTM model** to accurately capture volatility dynamics, offering superior performance compared to traditional methods.  

## Features  
✅ **Hybrid VAE-LSTM Model** – Combines Variational Autoencoders (VAE) with Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks for improved forecasting.  
✅ **High-Performance Data Processing** – Handles **100,000+ market data points** with an optimized preprocessing pipeline.  
✅ **State-of-the-Art Prediction Accuracy** – Achieves **R² = 0.87** and reduces **RMSE by 12%** compared to standard LSTMs.  
✅ **Hyperparameter Optimization** – Uses **Optuna** to fine-tune model parameters, cutting training time by **20%**.  
✅ **Efficient Inference** – Converts models to **TensorFlow Lite**, improving edge-device inference speed by **30%**.  
✅ **Comprehensive Visualization** – Generates **interactive 3D volatility surfaces** for market analysis.  

## Performance Highlights  
- **R² Score**: `0.87`  
- **RMSE Improvement**: `12%` reduction vs. standard LSTM models  
- **Training Time Optimization**: `20%` faster via Optuna  
- **Inference Speed Boost**: `30%` faster with TensorFlow Lite  

## Installation  
To set up ExoVol on your local machine, follow these steps:  

```sh
git clone https://github.com/premdev1234/ExoVol.git  
cd ExoVol  
pip install -r requirements.txt  
```

## Usage  
### 1️⃣ Preprocess Data  
```python
from exovol.data_processing import preprocess_data
data = preprocess_data("market_data.csv")
```

### 2️⃣ Train the Model  
```python
from exovol.model import train_model
model = train_model(data)
```

### 3️⃣ Generate Predictions  
```python
from exovol.predict import forecast_volatility
predictions = forecast_volatility(model, data)
```
